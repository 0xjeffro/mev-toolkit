## ERC-4337: account abstraction

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* "smart contract wallets": account abstraction that would avoid the need for consensus-layer protocol changes by enabling arbitrary logic to determine if an account can move funds. this enables wallets to have multi-sigs, social recovery, hardware enclaves, etc.
* erc-4337 it implements censorship-resistant aa without making any changes to the consensus layer of ethereum, by creating a new mempool, a smart contract wallet standard, and a shared entry point contract for managing user operations.
* bundlers (new actors that are either block builders, or users that can send transactions to block builders through a bundle marketplace) package up a set of objects into a tx making a call to a special contract and sending objects to a separate mempool.
