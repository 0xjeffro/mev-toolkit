## EigenLayer

### tl; dr

* currently, only a limited set of protocols can incentivize service-providers reliably
* restaking means taking staked ethereum and re-staking it on some other protocol, which can be slashed
* eigenlayer comes as a market between protocols and restakers, choosing from many different protocols
